## Capstone Project

The purpose of this README is to mention the data and the tools that are needed to run the Feature Construction, and Classifier code, which are the two notebooks that have been used for the project. Regarding the data, the files can be downloaded from [1], and the ones that are needed are the 'train.csv' and 'bids.csv'. As far as the code goes, python v3.6.4 has been used, along with the following tools:

- numpy,
- pandas, 
- matplotlib.pyplot,
- sklearn,
- xgboost

To replicate the results, after downloading 'train.csv' and 'bids.csv' and adding them into the data folder, the two notebooks should be run end-to-end, starting with 'Feature Creation - Capstone Project.ipynb' and then 'Classifier - Capstone Project.ipynb'.
